* Purifying adversarial images using an invertible normalizing flow model (NFM) and an adaptive gating network.

* NFM is deterministic, unlike generative models, giving tractable log-likelihood for each image in the manifold.

* Plans to use test-time latent optimization to project attacked images back onto the manifold.
